## Functionality:

### Start:

'Play Game' button at middle of the screen at the start

### When Playing:

Show random image with 2 buttons underneath 'HUMAN (human icon)' & 'AI (robot icon)'
If the player gets correct, go to next level.
If the player gets incorrect, end game and show high score with 'play again button'
After each answer show a small graph with the percentage of answered options from all players

### How to:

have a isPlaying state to keep track of wether to show the game or not
have a gameFinished state to know when to display the play again button and end game information (time spent? avg time per pic?)

keep track of answers on backend to have add a graph later on

{index: 1, answered: IA}

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
